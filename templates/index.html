ptpb

ptpb is a simple pastebin.

USE:

From the web: <a href="/f">Make a paste</a>

From the command line:
command | curl -F "c=&lt;-" https://ptpb.pw

EXAMPLE:

cat /etc/resolv.conf | curl -F "c=&lt;-" https://ptpb.pw

OTHER INFO:
Pastes will be kept as long as feasible, they may be deleted eventually though. Don't use ptpb for things you need to
keep around forever.
